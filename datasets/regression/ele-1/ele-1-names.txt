Electrical Lenght 1 data set

1: Description.

This problem with only two input variables involves a small search space (small complexity). However, it is still an interesting problem since the system is strongly nonlinear and the available data is limited to a low number of examples presenting noise. All of these drawbacks make the modeling surface complicated indeed and, in this case, produce a strong overfitting of the obtained models.
