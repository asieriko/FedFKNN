Diabetes dataset

1: Description.

This data set concerns the study of the factors affecting patterns of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in children. The objective is to investigate the dependence of the level of serum C-peptide on the various other factors in order to understand the patterns of residual insulin secretion. The response measurement is the logarithm of C-peptide concentration (pmol/ml) at the diagnosis, and the predictor measurements age and base deficit, a measure of acidity.
