Auto MPG (8 variables) dataset

1: Description.

The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon (Mpg), to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute Mpg, 6 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the Mpg attribute.

2: Type.			Regression
3: Origin.			Real world
4: Instances.		392
5: Features.		5
6: Missing values.	No
